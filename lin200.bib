    annotation = {This source is the primary `sounding board' for this paper, providing the definitions of a word I intend to argue against. Additionally it provides an abundance of general information about words and rebuffs counterarguments to its definitions. However, the counterarguments make little mention of languages other than English; this is a fact I intend to exploit in my paper.}

  author={Driver, Paul and Christiansen, Rupert},
  volume={5},
  year={1989},
  publisher={Taylor \& Francis},
  annotation={In this book, briefly alluded to during the conclusion of the paper, Taylor and Francis propose that wordhood should additionally be based on properties of pitch and tone of the language. Based on what I have researched about other languages as well as my own lingual intuition, I think this is a promising vein of research.}
